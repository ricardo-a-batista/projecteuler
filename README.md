## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that
will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help
you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills
will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform
for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and
recreational context.
